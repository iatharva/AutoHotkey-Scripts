## List of Scripts

- [Copy and Search on Google](https://github.com/iatharva/AutoHotkey-Scripts/tree/main/Copy%20and%20Search%20on%20Google)
- [Open a link in new tab](https://github.com/iatharva/AutoHotkey-Scripts/tree/main/Open%20Link%20in%20new%20Tab)

## How to use

- Simply run the downloaded script when needed and then you can use shortcuts as mentioned to perform the activity.
- If you don't want to run the script manually and set it to auto launch on startup then paste the script in the following path in your Windows 10 :

```
C:\Users\Username\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs\Startup
```
- If the shortcut is the combination of the keys and you used it once then you need to press all the combination of the keys again and repressing just one of keys in the combination won't work.
- Enjoy ðŸ™‚
